Original made by jomagom!I updated the script and made some clean in code!Add new menu, add configs!

###### Patch ######

1. Apply the .patch file to your ScriptDev2 folder and recompile

NOTE: If you're updating from a previous revision, make sure to 
      delete your old "professionnpc.cpp" file in the ScriptDev2/scripts/custom/ folder or you will get compiling errors.

2. Copy the new scriptdev2.conf to your server folder 


###### CPP ######

How to manually apply the professionnpc.cpp file:
Quote:Copy professionnpc.cpp from the "CPP file only" folder to your "ScriptDev2/scripts/custom/" folder.
[Linux only]Open makefile.am in your ScriptDev2 folder and find: scripts/eastern_kingdoms/alterac_mountains.cpp \ Above that, paste scripts/custom/professionnpc.cpp \ so it looks like this:

include/sc_instance.h \
scripts/battlegrounds/battleground.cpp \
scripts/custom/professionnpc.cpp \
scripts/eastern_kingdoms/alterac_mountains.cpp \
scripts/eastern_kingdoms/arathi_highlands.cpp \

Now open the ScriptLoader.cpp file from your ScriptDev2/system/ folder and find: "//custom" (without quotes). Under that, paste extern void AddSC_professionnpc(); so it looks like this:

//custom
extern void AddSC_professionnpc();

Now search for: "//custom" again (without quotes). Paste AddSC_professionnpc(); under it so it looks like this:

//custom
AddSC_professionnpc();

New open the SD2 solution (I use "scriptVC90.sln", but you want to use the one for your Visual Studio version).

In the Solution Explorer, expand 'Scripts->Custom'

Right-click the 'custom' folder and choose 'Add->Existing Item...' and browse to the professionnpc.cpp file

Compile SD2 as usual


###### SQL ######

Use ProfessionNPC.sql from Sql if you don't want to create your own NPC

If you create your own make sure to:
* Set npcflag to 1 for GOSSIP 
* Set ScriptName to "professionnpc"
